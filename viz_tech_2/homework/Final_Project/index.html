      <p class = "intro">
        My goal for the project showcases the effect of gender on dress code in <span class = "schools">481 schools</span> throughout the United States. Using data gathered by
        <a href="https://pudding.cool/2019/02/dress-code-sexualization/" class = "link">The Pudding</a>, this visualization will showcase the amount schools are being counted and how many target women marketed clothing for dress code
        violations. The group cluster layout and scrollytelling is a great way to document the number of schools that target clothing by gender.

                Through our findings, these schools punish students based on the item of clothing because they are viewed negatively or unsafe.

                  We take these <span class = "schools">481 schools</span> and showcase how many schools target different items of clothing. In this graphic, each bubble represents
                  an item of clothing;  the size of the bubbles are dependent on the number of schools that target the items; and the colors are
                  categorized by the market:<span class = "fem">female</span>,<span class = "male">male</span>, or <span class = "both">both</span>.

                 that is marketed towards women, which showcases the sexism in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/10/school-dress-codes-reinforce-the-message-that-womens-bodies-are-dangerous" class = "link">
