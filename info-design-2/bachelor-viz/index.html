          As a fan of reality television, the Bachelor is a reality tv show that has lasted for the test of time and was one of the first (if no the first) two integrate love and competition so for this project,
          I wanted to showcase a season of the Bachelor and how interaction leads to a winner and maybe a marriage. After almost 20 years of more often than not solid ratings, the Bachelor franchise has become part of America’s
          cultural fabric — scripted television is being made about it. Millions watch each week as the “bachelor” or “bachelorette” uses structured, on-camera dates to whittle down a group of previously unknown contestants
          (always of the opposite sex) until the lucky one remains.
      </p>


      <p class = "intro"> Through an <a href = "https://ew.com/gallery/ranking-seasons-the-bachelor/">EW Ranking</a>, I decided to use season 13 because it was said to be the best season of the show, which features previous
      Bachelorette runner-up and single father Jason Mesnick. The 13th season of The Bachelor premiered on January 5, 2009 and it features him courting and beginning relationships between 25 women.</p>
