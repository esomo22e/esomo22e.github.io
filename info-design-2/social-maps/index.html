  <h1>Mutual Aid Maps: Solidarity not Charity</h1>
  <p class = "intro_text">The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected the most vulnerable members of society as existing inequities were exacerbated by governments and people in power caught completely unprepared to cope with a disaster of this nature and magnitude. Simultaneously, man-made and natural disasters such as forest fires and severe weather added to existing pressure on limited resources, and due to social distancing, caused severe losses to life and livelihoods.Therefore, with no other means of support available, individuals and communities took to the internet to ask for support but also provided resources in solidarity with all those suffering during this time. </p>
  <p class = "intro_text">The maps below are a short representation of mutual aid stories sourced from Twitterâ€™s API between (dates). The data used to populate this map is from tweets with keywords venmo, paypal, mutualaid, gofundme, cashapp, crowdfund, donate, donations, fund, funds, help, and support. Our code scraped approximately 500 tweets per keyword and compiled a dataset of 510 campaigns across 43 states in the United States.</p>
  <p class = "intro_text">Each <span class="image-use"><img src="./images/solidarity4.png" ></span> represent a single fund.</p>
