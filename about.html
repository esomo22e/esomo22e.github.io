					<p>Interactive Designer, Installation Artist, and Creative Technologist that focuses on using various tools and mediums to build
						participatory experiences to answer the question at hand.</p>
					<p>I hold a Bachelor of Arts from Mount Holyoke College where I developed an interdisciplinary major called Interactive Design and Development,
						which integrates computer science, art studio, and design thinking.</p>
					<p>My goal for my projects is to explore questions that I have through different materials, ranging from cloth to data, in order
						to process information and tell stories. Using those tools and fusing a variety of materials allows me to explore various themes
						and find answers.</p>
					<p>My recent work involves working with data and exploring ways to visualize data through various mediums, both digitally and physically,
						to approach ways to communicate a diverse range of ideas. Overall, my work allows me to try to visualize and understand issues facing marginalized
						communities.</p>
